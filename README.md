# 🧩 Wireframing

## 📘 Introduction

**Wireframing** is the process of creating a visual guide that represents the skeletal framework of a digital product such as a website or mobile app. It is a crucial step in the **User Interface (UI)** and **User Experience (UX)** design process.

Wireframes are typically created in the early stages of product development and serve as a blueprint that outlines the structure, layout, and functionality of key components on each screen or page.

## 🎯 Importance of Wireframing in the Design Process

- **Clarifies Structure and Layout**  
  Wireframes help designers and developers understand where content, images, buttons, and other elements will appear — before visual design begins.

- **Improves Communication**  
  Wireframes create a shared understanding between designers, developers, and stakeholders by visually explaining the functionality of an interface.

- **Saves Time and Cost**  
  By identifying usability issues early, wireframing prevents expensive rework later in development.

- **Supports User-Centered Design**  
  Designers can focus on functionality, navigation flow, and user experience without being distracted by colors and typography.

## 🧱 Key Elements of a Wireframe

### 1. **Layout Structure**
Defines the general arrangement of page elements, such as headers, footers, sidebars, and main content areas.

### 2. **Navigation**
Shows how users move through the product, including menus, navigation bars, breadcrumbs, and links.

### 3. **Content Placement**
Indicates where content types like text, images, or videos are positioned.

### 4. **Functionality**
Represents interactive elements like buttons, forms, dropdowns, or sliders.

## 🧾 Types of Wireframes

Wireframes are often categorized by their **level of detail (fidelity)**. The two most common types are:

### 🟡 Low-Fidelity Wireframes
- **Definition:** Simple sketches or grayscale mockups focused on structure, layout, and flow.
- **Purpose:** Early-stage planning and brainstorming.
- **Characteristics:**
  - Minimal styling
  - Placeholder text/images
  - Basic shapes and outlines
- **When to Use:** During the initial ideation or when presenting concepts to stakeholders for feedback without distracting visual details.

### ⚫ High-Fidelity Wireframes
- **Definition:** Detailed mockups that closely resemble the final UI, often including real content, images, and exact spacing.
- **Purpose:** Closer to development, used to finalize design decisions.
- **Characteristics:**
  - Real or near-real content
  - Detailed visuals, spacing, and styling
  - Clickable elements or interactions (sometimes)
- **When to Use:** Before handoff to developers or during usability testing.

## 🧠 What Type of Wireframe is This?

> _In this section, describe the type of wireframe used in your project._

**Example:**
> The wireframe used in this project is a **low-fidelity wireframe** created to visualize layout and navigation flow without focusing on design elements like colors or typography. It was used in early-stage discussions to refine the user journey and page structure.

## 📌 When to Use Wireframes

- At the start of the UI/UX design process.
- When planning features for a new app or website.
- During brainstorming or feedback sessions with clients or stakeholders.
## 🛠️ Popular Wireframing Tools

Wireframing can be done using a variety of digital tools that help designers create and share their ideas effectively. Below are some of the most widely used tools in the industry:
