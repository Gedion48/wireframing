# ðŸ§© Wireframing

## ðŸ“˜ Introduction

**Wireframing** is the process of creating a visual guide that represents the skeletal framework of a digital product such as a website or mobile app. It is a crucial step in the **User Interface (UI)** and **User Experience (UX)** design process.

Wireframes are typically created in the early stages of product development and serve as a blueprint that outlines the structure, layout, and functionality of key components on each screen or page.

## ðŸŽ¯ Importance of Wireframing in the Design Process

- **Clarifies Structure and Layout**  
  Wireframes help designers and developers understand where content, images, buttons, and other elements will appear â€” before visual design begins.

- **Improves Communication**  
  Wireframes create a shared understanding between designers, developers, and stakeholders by visually explaining the functionality of an interface.

- **Saves Time and Cost**  
  By identifying usability issues early, wireframing prevents expensive rework later in development.

- **Supports User-Centered Design**  
  Designers can focus on functionality, navigation flow, and user experience without being distracted by colors and typography.
